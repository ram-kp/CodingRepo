git commands that ive learnt 

1. simple cloning into repository
	git clone url
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "message"  // commiting the latest changes
4. git push	// push the changes into our repository

5. git pull 	// pulling the latest updated files from our repository

6. branching -> git branch -> git branch <branchName> -> git checkout <branchName> or git checkout -b branchname

7.
	Then the issue is that you have not configured git to always create new branches on the remote from local ones.
	The permanent fix if you always want to just create that new branch on the remote to mirror and track your local branch is:

 	git config --global push.default current

8. git diff - to see changes

9. forking repository -> click fork(creates your version of repository) -> add and commit changes -> 
	-> either git push origin master or create new branch and push in that(later we can create pull request to add changes to the organizations version of project)

10. my-project (repo name on server) & origin (short name on local repository alias for url)

11. ORIGIN , why cant we have origin named as our remote repo -> this is because if my friend forks my remote repo i would two remote repos with same name ( but this problem eleminated as we now have two remotes 1.origin 2. Friend (git remote add <remote repo name> )
12. If i forked a project and want to be updated with my parent version i must do git remote add upstream (url of parent), then i can pull from it to remain updated
13. To add to the previously made repo:
	--> git init --> git remote add origin (url) --> git pull origin main --> git add . --> git commit --> git push origin master
