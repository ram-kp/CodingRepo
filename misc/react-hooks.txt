const [ Robots, setRobots ] = useState([ ]); // hooks the Robots state into our react store , setRobots is used to set the state of the robots 
// [ a, b ] = [ 1, 2 ] this is nothing but array destructuring which is released with the newer version of ecmascript
// We give the initial state of Robots (empty array here) inside the useState() method;


useEffect is always rendered whenever our app loads.
It may be a fetch call , setting one of the state.
UseEffect is analoguos to the life cycle method.

sequence of events (defining state via react hooks)
-> When app renders it creates state
-> Then it runs useEffect
-> Then it fetched via an api and sets the robots state
-> As soon as the state changes, our app rerenders
-> Then again it runs useEffect and the same thing occurs again and again

SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM
useEffect( () => {
	fetch(url)
	.then(res => res.json())
	.then(users => {setRobots(users)})
}, [ ])	// Run useEffect only When the state/array is empty ie similar to component did mount life cycle method of class component
