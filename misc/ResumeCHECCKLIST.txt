E. Achievements
	- Different coding platform stats -> example - AIR 11 on GFG, 5* Codechef, 500 questions on Leetcode
	- Point around/Hackathons/Open-source contribution/Contests/Challenge/Udacity-Sholarships/Different-Coding Programmes
	- Though certificates doesnt matter , you can include them as well in this section
	- Teaching assistance at some ABCD institute

4. Points to Keep in mind
	- Beautify and show your stength and weaknesses
	- Make it more tech-oriented
	- Always provide your work with stats and impact created 
	- Always try to host your project in real world scenerio
	- always boldify tech words to grab attention
	- always include sourceCode hyperlinks
	- avoid fancy resume template, try to create a simplistic and easy to read resume
	- You can skip the ordering if you hae SOLID superpower in one domain, ex: CP, Dev , IN THAT CASE YOU CAN KEEP THAT SECTION ABOVE ALL TO GRAB ATTENTION OF RECRUITER
	- If You Dont have Prior-company experience or any internship experience. No need to worry just skip that section and add 2-3 SOLID projects based on different tech stacks and unique ideas
	- Never write Project details in paragraphs.  Give bullet point experience

5. Avoid these mistakes
	- Interests like Dancing, Singing, Gaming etc -> As we are here for a tech job, lets provide only job description required details
	- Never include Level of profieciency on skills -> example : C++ me 5/5 etc
	- Courses taken and their certificates - Generally they does not create any sort of impact on recruiters but if ypu want to fill 1-2 line of space you can include them(along with certificates hyperlinks)
	- Languages Known : Hindi/Bhojpuri/English etc
	- Extra Curricular  or PORs 
		- Not that beneficial in case of tech-job resume shortlisting
		- If related to coding/Development, then it makes sense to add in resume

- Relevel = register and get the job if you have the required set of skills.
