// SHORTEST PATH? --> Special case algo.
// Unlike this, 
// BFS assumes that each path has same weight.

// In real life(google maps) the edges may represent distance, traffic, etc
// And vertex represent a location.

// Bellman algo. is more effective in finding the shortest path than Dijkstra algo.
// because it can accomodate -ve numbers.

// Dijkstra algo. is bit faster than latter as latter's worst case is 0(n^2)
