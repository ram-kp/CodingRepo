// MINDSET
// 1. biggest mistake wen we think that it is our only chance, it is not pass/fail or live/die
// 2. Dont hope for a job or anything, treat everything as a learning experience
// 3. Interveiwer is excited if you are excited, enter the room with energy/big smile
// 4. Before entering think that you are going to meet your very good friend

// Interveiwer is more likely to ask/answer you 3 Question

// 1. Can you do the job?          --> we know how to answer the technical questions
// 2. Can i work with you?         
// 3. Are you going to improve?

// Remember 4 Heroes
// Before entering recall these 4 heroic stories -->
// 1. Technical -- the project you worked, a big project in your portfolio
// 2. Success -- if you build something say app or in something where you were successful
// 3. LeaderShip -- are you the person to take charge and can be left on their own.
// 4. Challenge -- tell them the story, the challenging technical problem that you've been through in a project and how you overcome it.

// WE ARE GOING TO TELL THE STORIES AND PREPARE IT BEFORE INTERVEIW, we may change them a bit.
