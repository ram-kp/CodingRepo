// 	Everything went well and you nailed the interveiw, uh used 4 heroes.
// First of all never give up, remember you are not competing for 100%, you are competing against the candidates
// There are ways you can improve those odd and you still stand out.

// SECRET WEAPONS:
// How a top coder gets selected

// => Simplicity over complexity(code has to be maintainable, readable, its for other not for yourself, working in a team means making sure the code is readable and maintainable)
// => Premature optimization is the root of all evils (work within time, how many resources you have, performance)
// => Overall goal, not myopic (dont ignore everything due to some specific problem, you have to understand the need of projects and clients)
// => No complaining about clients/code/etc.(you are a pleasant person)
// => No ego, construct criticisism
