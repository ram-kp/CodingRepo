// BINARY HEAP

// parent is always greater than children
// no left less than right kinda rule
// compared to lookup in BST it 0(n) in this case
// memory Heap(memory allocated) != Heap data structure
// priority queues - elements in the queue have different priority, example - operation theater, vips at V.T., passengers at Planes
// pros - better than 0(n), priority, flexible size, fast Insert

//  TRIE

// searching on text , can outperform many DSs 
// Big O = 0(length of the word)
